		<p>Many algorithms’ scenarios were discussed before the team concluded to the final one which is described further on. One of the reasons for the multiple scenarios was the abundance of data and the possibility of multiple combinations that the team should think about. But our core interest regarding the subject of the algorithm was to give voice to female artists. 
		<br>
			Thus, the team reached the following scenario:  to provide a recommendation list of exhibitions along with their associated artworks, creators of a specific gender and their nationality (sorted in alphabetical order). This compilation is based on the selection criteria (exhibition’s year and creator’s gender) and could be used by researchers (e.g., in the field of Gender Science and Fine Art) or by upcoming visitors to the museum.</p>

			<p>
				The algorithm is based on given input for a selected year. It shows the exhibitions along with its creators and their artworks. 
				It is possible to get artworks by gender if you want to get the artworks of the exhibitions based on the available genders in the exhibitions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The first part of our algorithm is comprised of the input statements and the last part of the output statements that would potentially display the desired result on the screen. It starts with reading all the entities of our data set. After that, the team wanted an empty table to be created in our algorithm so that the values that the potential user needs could be inserted in it. Since the user is free to select the date of the exhibition we used an iteration (WHILE) statement so that the computer will start checking all the entries on the table until the desired values are found. Furthermore, since the user can choose the gender of the creator according to his/her preferences we created also a WHILE statement for this case so that the artworks of all creators of the selected gender will be displayed.
