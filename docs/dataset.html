			<h2>Motivation to select the specific dataset</h2>
			<p>The Walters Art Museum repository's collections on GitHub includes an API that describes several datasets. All the datasets are in csv format, easy to deal with and to make the proper changes wanted by the group. The final selection of the datasets (creators, artworks, collections, exhibitions) was conducted based on the need captured through the team’s brainstorming. The scope behind this selection will be revealed in the “Algorithm” page.</p>

			<h2>Description of data model</h2>
			<P>After the selection of the datasets, the team proceeded to define the data model to serve the purpose and requirements of the algorithm. The final data model, based on the team’s brainstorming, includes 4 entities where each entity represents specific attributes of various data types (e.g., integer, text). All the elements, the primary and foreign keys, the established relationships among them and a related example are presented in detail to the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and to the tabular form below:</P>

			<P>The ERD for the Walters Art Museum is centered around the artworks. Every artwork must have a number of creators who also could be a creator of multiple artworks. An artwork could be included in one collection and shown in many exhibitions. A collection must include artworks and an exhibition must include artworks as well.</P>

			<h2>Description of data curation</h2>
			<p>Based on the data model, each dataset was elaborated in a way that is relevant for the algorithm to work. Starting from the entity “creators” for making the proper correlations with the other entities, the project team decided to use Python as an automated way to curate the dataset to suit the algorithm. The curation guided us to make the final filtering of 75 creators and of the related data effectively. Some problems that we encountered was for example cells that included two different values (e.g., “Persian, ca. 1565-1635", nationality and the birth date of creator) which needed to be separated in order to be normalized but they were not consistent in the original dataset. Some of the creators had only the nationality given, and some provided the date which made it difficult to curate. The curation made with Python resulted in clean enough data for splitting the values, but some values had to be manually identified and changed because of the inconsistency.</p>
			<p>The dataset was divided into separate entities already when provided but had some redundancy of repeated values that were not fully consistent such as the collections being represented by name and id also in the artwork table. For enabling flexibility to change, the entities were separated and referenced by their id as foreign keys in other tables. Ensuring that the data was parsable in a valid format for the data types assured the quality of the columns, although it is difficult to validate texts such as the nationality when not following a pattern.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the original datasets included multiple data, and during the data analysis, it was indicated that most of the creators were men. So, it was decided to filter the creators in a way that both women and men exist inside the dataset and not just a random selection of the first e.g., 75 creators where women would be the minority. We were interested in keeping our curation practices aligned with ethical standards. All the curated datasets are included in file “curateddata”.</p>
