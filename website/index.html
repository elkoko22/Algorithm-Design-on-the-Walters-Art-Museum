<p>For this assignment the team has chosen to work with data from the <a href="https://thewalters.org">“Walters Art Museum”</a> in Baltimore, Maryland. From the very beginning, it was decided to focus on a dataset that covers a common interest in art. So, searching GitHub, the team concluded to <a href="https://github.com/WaltersArtMuseum/api-thewalters-org">Walters Art Museum collections.</a> </p>
<p>To learn more about the chosen datasets, how the team model and curate the data, the choices in algorithm design and the team’s labor division, please see the related pages from the top menu.</p>
<p>Particularly, since we want our database to display the top ten topics with the most entries across a given time period and all articles of a given topic this means that we can find one topic connected to more than one articles. So, for making this possible I added one more foreign key to the table  “Article” so that the linkage will be created and the information we are asking for can be effectively retrieved.</p>
<p> On the other hand for getting the desired result based on the second and third question of our scenario I considered that a third linkage is required between the entities “Article” and “Topic”. </p>
