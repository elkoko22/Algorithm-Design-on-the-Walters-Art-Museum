	<p>Many algorithms’ scenarios were discussed before the team concluded to the final one which is described further on. One of the reasons for the multiple scenarios was the abundance of data and the possibility of multiple combinations that the team should think about. But our core interest regarding the subject of the algorithm was to give voice to female artists.  

		Thus, the team reached the following scenario:  to provide a recommendation list of exhibitions along with their associated artworks, creators of a specific gender and their nationality (sorted in alphabetical order). This compilation is based on the selection criteria (exhibition’s year and creator’s gender) and could be used by researchers (e.g., in the field of Gender Science and Fine Art) or by upcoming visitors to the museum.</p>
