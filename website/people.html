<p>This project consists of four group members, which are Aggeliki Spandonidou, Denise, Elena Kokoliou, and Lovisa Johansson.</p>
<p><b>Aggeliki Spandonidou</b>: responsible for conceptualization, data curation, web design, website text elaboration defining and finalizing the pseudocode.</p>
<p><b>Denise</b>: responsible for conceptualization, data curation (creators and filtering task), website text elaboration, defining pseudocode, check & submitting the assignment.</p>
<p><b>Elena Kokoliou</b>: responsible for conceptualization, data curation, defining pseudocode, creating the website texts, overall team activities organization and final overview of Github and its components.</p>
<p><b>Lovisa Johansson</b>: responsible for conceptualization, data curation (mainly use of python), website text elaboration, defining and finalizing the pseudocode.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The team members collectively addressed all aspects of the assignment. Some of the parts were created during group meetings as well as separately independent work. Specifically:</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b>: all members expressed their ideas about possible datasets, analyzed the data and agreed to the final entities with their attributes. Denise's observation regarding the predominance of male creators led the team to develop a dataset aimed at mitigating gender bias.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b>: All the team members identified data weaknesses and ways to be solved but the programming background of Lovisa and her knowledge in python language allowed for the automation of some curation tasks, saving time and enabling the team to focus on necessary manual curation.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b>The pseudocode is a result of team work too. While someone was writing the pseudocode the rest made proposals for changes or additions. Elena was meticulously repeating the scenario to find out the weaknesses and improve the scenario expressed in pseudocode. Lovisa, with knowledge and experience of programming, had a realistic view of the possibilities and limitations.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b>: Elena established the GitHub repository inviting the rest of the members to contribute. Aggeliki created the structure of the website based on her previous html knowledge and the rest of the team contributed to add the required content.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b>: Elena checked if all required components in Github were set. Denise submitted the assignment.</p>
<br>
<p>To sum up, the assignment started with a few brainstorming sessions among the team members. During subsequent meetings, the team assigned tasks to individual members based on their skills and prior knowledge. However, even if an activity was completed by one member, the steps of the activity were explained aiming all the members to have a common understanding and learning.</p>
