575,oil paintings (visual works); panel paintings,The Important Response,oil on panel,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/575,"<p>A lady in early 17th-century attire is seated at a table pondering a letter she is writing. In the background is a high Japanese screen. The artist has lavished great care in the rendering of the contrasting surfaces of his subject's satin dress and of the rug covering the table. In its intimacy and in its oriental note, this work approximates the painting of Alfred Stevens.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/575"" rel=""external alternate main"">oil paintings (visual works); panel paintings</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

Based on the same source as the Annunciation plaque by Jean Limosin (Walters 44.346), this piece is notable for the brilliance of the translucent enamel colors, especially the garnet red, and the delicately applied gilding, although the overall emphasis on surface pattern, dazzling though it is, nearly flattens out the space.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/1196"" rel=""external alternate main"">plaques</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

The 300-year-long reign of the Romanov dynasty ended in 1917 in the revolution that cost Nicholas II his life. Later, in the 1920s, Henry Walters, founder of the Walters Art Museum, was able to buy a select group of objects with connections to the Russian royal family, including this piece. Jeweled boxes were often given as diplomatic gifts, and hardstone carving, in nephrite, malachite, or jasper, for example, was a Russian specialty.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/1327"" rel=""external alternate main"">boxes (containers)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"
1377,portraits; oil paintings,Portrait of Marquess Massimiliano Stampa,oil on canvas,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/1377,"<p>The boy can be identified as the nine-year-old Massimiliano Stampa, third marquess of the small northern Italian city of Soncin, on the basis of a contemporary annotation on the back of the canvas. This is Sophonisba Anguissola's first major commission. The family commissioned it to commemorate the boy's inheritance of his title in 1557, at his father's death. Anguissola was a sympathetic observer of children: here she leavens the stern, very ""adult,"" impression of the full-length portrait in the traditional black clothing of the Italian courts during the 16th century with the appeal of child's hesitant expression and the inclusion of the boy's sleeping pet.

2659,plates,Plate Showing Imps on a Bridge and Tree House,lusterware,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/2659,"<p>The Wedgwood factory gave Susannah Margaretta (Daisy) Makeig-Jones (1881-1945) her own design studio in 1915. Drawing on her early love of fairy stories, she introduced an imaginative line of decorative wares that remained popular throughout the 1920s. This particular design was introduced in 1924. Engravers transferred Makeig-Jones's designs to copper plates for printing onto paper sheets known as pottery tissues. While the ink was still wet on the pottery tissues, the images were rubbed onto the ceramic surfaces. Women painters then applied the colors to these designs on the ceramics, a process that necessitated several firings, and then added the colorful glazes. The gold details were added last.

He was mainly employed in adapting, re-modelling and finishing busts and bas reliefs, such as the ones that appear on these vases.

4432,eggs; vessels,Gatchina Palace Egg,"gold, ""en plein"" enamel, silver-gilding, portrait diamonds, rock crystal, and seed pearls",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/4432,"<p>Continuing a practice initiated by his father, Alexander III, Tsar Nicholas II presented this egg to his mother, the dowager empress Marie Fedorovna, on Easter 1901. The egg opens to reveal as a surprise a miniature gold replica of the palace at Gatchina, located 30 miles southwest of St. Petersburg. Built for Count Grigorii Orlov, the palace was acquired by Tsar Paul I and served as the winter residence for Alexander III and Marie Fedorovna.

Fabergé's revival of 18th-century enameling techniques, including the application of multiple layers of translucent enamel over ""guilloché,"" or mechanically engraved gold, is demonstrated in the shell of the egg. So meticulously did Fabergé's workmaster, Mikhail Perkhin, execute the palace that one can discern such details as cannons, a flag, a statue of Paul I (1754-1801), and elements of the landscape, including parterres and trees.

6301,portraits; busts,Bust of Dr. Dio Lewis,marble,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/6301,"<p>Edmonia Lewis was the first African American sculptor to receive international recognition. Born in Greenbush, New York, to a Haitian father of African descent and a mother of Native American and African American descent, Lewis spent a brief time in Boston studying with the sculptor Edward Brackett. In 1866, she moved from Boston to Rome, Italy, to study sculpture and to escape racial discrimination. Lewis adopted the prevailing Neoclassical style of sculpture but softened it with a degree of naturalism. She had a successful career specializing in biblical subjects, themes recalling her Native American and African American ancestry, and portrait busts of important people.

This portrait bust of Diocletian Lewis (1823–86), was made in the artist's Rome studio. Dio Lewis (no relation) who trained in medicine at Harvard College's medical department and practiced briefly in Buffalo, New York, is remembered chiefly for lectures and publications dealing with preventive medicine and physical hygiene, as well as for his support of liberal causes, including women's rights.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/6301"" rel=""external alternate main"">portraits; busts</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

7684,oil paintings (visual works),A Harvest Shower,oil on fabric,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/7684,"<p>Wilkie Collins, in ""Memoirs of the Life of William COllins, Esq., R.A.,"" London, 1848, vol. 1, p. 70, relates the following genesis of this picture:

""The 'Harvest Shower' was suggested on a visit to Windsor, by a beautiful effect, produced durring a shower, by the appearance of bright clouds behind falling rain.  As soon as he perceived it, although reminded by his companion, Mr. Stark, of an engagement they had the moment before been hastened to fulfill, Mr. Collins produced his sketchbook; and careless alike of rain and punctuality, made a study of the scene, which he afterwards transferred to canvass, and exhibited as above related.""

The rolling expance of landscape is bisected by a stream.  At the left, in the immediate foreground, a young man seated on a log is baiting his fishing line.  His jacket lies on the ground beside a hamper.  Further left, are several gnarled trees and some vegetation including poppies and burdock.  A girl and a young boy carrying bundles of wheat make their way towards the viewer along a path that extends back into a distant field in which grain is being harvested.  Beyond is a wood in which there are a number of houses and in the remote background hills rise.  The bank of the stream in the right foreground is lost in shadow.  Cattle graze in the fields further back, and a couple of spires are visible through the woods in the background on the right side.  The most startling feature of this composition is the juxtaposition of the dark rain clouds against the sunlit sky.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/7684"" rel=""external alternate main"">oil paintings (visual works)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"
8783,paintings,The Sacrificial Lamb,oil on canvas,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/8783,"<p>The inscription refers to Christ as the Lamb whose death was foretold. This symbolism of Christ as a sacrificial lamb who brings salvation derives from the feast of Passover, instituted after the Lord saved the Jews in Egypt who brushed the blood of slaughtered lambs over their doors.

Although Ayala spent most of her life in Portugal, this work reflects the influence of the art of her native Seville, Spain. She has modeled her composition and her style-with the strong contrasts of light and dark and attention to realistic detail-on paintings of Francisco de Zurbarán (1598-1664), also from that city. Ayala was one of the few women artists active in Spain and Portugal. She was renowned for her ability to paint still lifes and portraits, subjects that were considered appropriate for female painters.

9356,drawings (visual works),Margot (Lefebvre) in Blue,"pastel on brown, moderately thick, slightly textured, wove paper",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/9356,"<p>Mary Cassatt, the daughter of a wealthy Pennsylvania banker, traveled extensively through Italy, Belgium and Spain and trained in Paris with several notable teachers including Gérôme and Couture. She met Degas in 1877, and though their friendship would be fitful and end in total estrangement, the encounter proved meaningful for both artists. Under Degas' influence, Cassatt's early, earthy realist style gave way to a more impressionistic approach. He in turn, recruited a sympathetic artisan for his realist faction of Impressionism. Like Degas, Cassatt explored various techniques, including pastels and graphics. She also shared his abiding interest in Japanese art. Excluded from many of her male colleagues' haunts, Cassatt appropriated as her specialty images of upper-class women and children. Characteristic of her later work is this pastel, ""Margot in Blue,"" showing a child wearing a floppy white bonnet and blue dress.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/9356"" rel=""external alternate main"">drawings (visual works)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

The gem is inscribed vertically on the right with the name of a well-known gem-carver of the late 1st century BCE, ΓNAIOΥ (Gnaios). The intaglio has been largely abraded due to early modern cleaning.

Vladimir Soloviev assumed control of an independent workshop that had been founded in St. Petersburg by Phillip Theodor Ringe (1824-82) and had subsequently been operated by Anders Mickelson (1839-1918).

9874,oil paintings (visual works),Judith with the Head of Holofernes,oil on canvas,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/9874,"<p>According to the Book of Judith, the Jewish widow Judith saved the Israelites from the Assyrians by decapitating their general Holofernes, whose army had besieged her city. She did this after having made him drunk at a banquet. Judith is commonly depicted as being assisted by an older maidservant in placing the head in a sack. The contrast between Holofernes's crude features and the heroine's beauty underlines the moral message of the eventual triumph of virtue over evil.

The Bolognese painter Elisabetta Sirani based her style on that of Guido Reni (1575-1642), who was admired for his idealized depictions of women, as in his Penitent Magdalene (Walters 37.2631). This painting is close to her style but it also appears to owe something to that of her father Giovanni Andrea Sirani.

The flamboyant sweep of the composition and emphasis on blossoms that are full to slightly past their prime mark this flower piece as from the second half of the 17th century when the baroque style touched even flower painting. The motif on the vase of putti (chubby todlers, more knowing and worldly than their apparent age would suggest) adds a classicizing tone to the floral display that reflects the expanding influence of French tastes throughout Europe. This is a rare signed piece by the daughter of Jan Peeters I, who worked in Antwerp and painted Southern Seaport in a Storm (Walters 37.1921). Only her birth date is known. Women painters were generally thought more capable of portraiture or flower painting, thus subjects drawn from life, not requiring leaps of a vigorous imagination such as the more “manly” painting of history subjects, which might require preparation in an academy or workshop where the study of the human body would be necessary…and considered inappropriate for women.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/13532"" rel=""external alternate main"">paintings</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

The detail, sense of movement, and expression suggest that this is a likeness of a particular individual. He was probably enslaved. The existence of other versions of this bust or figure with different insignia or attributes, in marble as well as in bronze, suggests that although the artist probably initially portrayed a specific young boy whose identity is now lost, this work quickly became a “type,” that could be used to convey different subjects involving an African boy.  
De Cock was one of the leading sculptors working in the Southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium) in the years around 1700.

The House of Fabergé began making hardstone animals in the 1890s and they proved popular with their elite clients. Queen Alexandra (wife of the British King Edward VII) built a large collection, and production peaked in the years immediately before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Objects such as this anteater were inspired by Japanese netsuke. Carl Fabergé owned over 500 of these. He married this admiration of Asian art with the rich Russian tradition of hardstone carving.

Marie Antoinette of Lorraine (1755-93) married Louis XVI in 1770 and shared her husband's fate in 1793.

At the time of accession this miniature was attributed to Hall, however, as the style is rather more precise than his typical work it may be by another artist or a follower of Hall.

In 1879, when she had developed a fully impressionistic style, Degas invited her to participate in the 4th impressionist exhibition. At that time, she also began to produce major works in pastel, drawing with remarkably vigorous and intense strokes.

17872,drawings (visual works),The Conversation,"charcoal heightened with white guache on blue/gray, moderately thick, heavily textured wove paper",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/17872,"<p>Bonheur's art was underpinned by detailed, analytical study, and she is known to have visited slaughterhouses and dissected animals to acquire an understanding of anatomy. In the 1850s, she also kept a collection of horses, sheep, and goats in her Paris studio for study purposes. Later, she kept an even larger menagerie, including lions, at her château in By at the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where she moved in 1860 and lived for the rest of her life (""Rosa Bonheur,"" Bordeaux, 1997). 

This drawing shows a shepherd and his dog absorbed in their own private ""conversation."" They sit silhouetted against the light breaking through the clouds. The drawing demonstrates Bonheur's ability to imbue her animals with near-human emotions. Particularly prominent is the ram to the right with large curled horns, which looks out at the spectator, as does the sheep in the center, which watches the viewer out of the corner of its eye. The costume of the shepherd, particularly his wide-brimmed hat, suggests that the scene takes place in the Pyrenees, which Bonheur had first visited in 1850. Thereafter, she regularly represented the shepherds of the Pyrenees and their flocks, including notably the ""Shepherd in the Pyrenees,"" (1864) in the Musée Condé, Chantilly. 

This was the first drawing by a French artist acquired by William T. Walters. He purchased it from the New York branch of the art dealer Goupil on 28 April 1860.

Mercuriale points to one thought-provoking illustration: a human skeleton meditating on another skull. The portrait may be one requested by the duke of Urbino in 1588. Mercuriale's learning is advertised by the works of eminent Greek, Roman, and Arab authors on his shelves.

Lavinia Fontana was among the most sought-after painters in her native Bologna. Among her many commissioned portraits, two groups stand out: images of scholars (the University of Bologna was then the largest in Europe) and portraits of the city's noblewomen. To the first group belongs this portrait of Mercuriale, who taught at the University. 

Because of the social structure, it was extremely rare for women to become professional artists. To the scholars of Bologna, Lavinia would therefore have been something of a marvel of nature.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/19054"" rel=""external alternate main"">portraits; panel paintings; oil paintings</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

It, in turn, was modeled after a lost original 4th-century BC bronze statue by the famous Greek sculptor Lysippus. In 1546, Glykon's statue was discovered during an excavation in Rome and was displayed in the garden of the palace belonging to the Farnese family, hence its name (it is now in the National Archeological Museum, Naples).

The statue, with its impressive rendering of Hercules's physique, was instantly famous, and admiration for it was reflected in the widespread ownership of small and full-size copies. While in Rome, the great Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens (1576-1640) made drawings of the colossus that he used for his paintings. There was even a full-size plaster cast in a 17th-century collection in Antwerp.

20681,statuettes (statues),Torso of Hercules Resting (Fragment),marble,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/20681,"<p>This marble torso appears to be a fragment of a small-scale copy after a famous lost bronze statue by the Greek sculptor Lysippos (ca. 320 BCE) of the hero Hercules. Here he leans on his club after completing the last of his labors: retrieving the golden apples of the Hesperides, which in the original Hercules held in his left hand behind his back. Here that hand is wrapped in drapery. Since the carving with its deep undercutting is actually later sixteenth-century Italian, this piece, carefully broken to maintain the torso which was the part thought to best demonstrate Lysippos' subtlety, was surely created to look ancient and fool the eye of a potential collector.  

In the late 1500s, Lysippos's  bronze statue was known in Italy through the marble copy made in the 3rd century CE by the sculptor Glykon, discovered in Rome in 1546 and acquired by the Farnese family for their palace there. Knowledge of that statue was dispersed by full-scale plaster casts and small-scale copies in bronze. So it was in the decades following the discovery of the Roman marble copy that interest was highest. Indeed, in the 1590s, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria owned an ""antique"" marble torso of Hercules that is similar to the Walters' sculpture. Ferdinand's torso, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, is now also considered a 16th-century forgery.

Her career as an artist was aided by the growing market of the late 19th and early 20th century for women's arts and crafts. At the Exposition Universelle of 1889, Pomey-Ballue won a silver medal for her work.

Most of her painting was limited to miniatures, and she frequently depicted her children or religious figures. In this gilt-framed watercolor on ivory, Pomey-Ballue shows the Virgin Mary seated holding a spindle. The symbolic meaning of the spindle dates back to 14th-century representations of the Virgin, alluding to her role as a mother and wife. The chore of spinning was considered to be a metaphor for a woman's virtuousness, as well as her submission to God and to her husband.

In catalogs of the Walters collection from 1893, 1895 and 1901 this miniature is described as being a portrait of the artist Girodet de Roucy-Trioson, a pupil of David, but it was also thought that it might be a self-portrait by Hall.

26514,oil paintings (visual works),Portrait of a Man at Prayer with Saint John the Baptist,"oil on panel, cut down at top and bottom",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/26514,"<p>Hugo van der Goes (active ca. 1440-1482) was one of the major portraitists of 15th-century Europe, at a time when portraiture gained importance under the impact of the new individualism fostered by humanism.  A common type of portrait was the depiction of a man or woman in prayer, experiencing a vision, often of the Virgin.  This small panel, cut down slightly at the top and bottom, was originally the right wing of a small altarpiece made of only two paintings, known as a diptych. The subject of the left wing would have been the Virgin and Child. It is to them that Saint John directs the praying donor's devotion. 

This unidentified donor (the person who donated or commissioned the work of art) is shown completely absorbed in the vision of the Virgin and Child. During this period, it was thought inappropriate to show strong emotion in public, but Hugo was very sensitive to the most subtle facial expression that give clues to a person's mental state.  The man's deep concentration is wonderfully captured in his raised eyebrow and contracted muscles around the mouth.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/26514"" rel=""external alternate main"">oil paintings (visual works)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"
28720,urns; covers,Urn with Cover,"nephrite, gold, rubies, diamonds",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/28720,"<p>This tureen-shaped urn is carved of nephrite, a green jade much favored by the Fabergé firm. Enormous nephrite boulders had been discovered along the Onot River in eastern Siberia in 1851. A pair of loving doves in pavé-set diamonds and a cupid's bow and arrows in green and red gold--both motifs associated with the French 18th-century master François Boucher--are mounted on the urn's cover. Suspended from alternating diamonds and rubies are yellow gold garlands with red gold ties. Rows of diamonds, interspersed at intervals with rubies, line the rim of the urn. This piece is of exceptional quality and may, in fact, be an imperial commission.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/28720"" rel=""external alternate main"">urns; covers</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

Inspired by Japanese netsuke, which Fabergé collected in great numbers, these tiny animals have a life-like quality.

Fetti painted this work while court artist to the Gonzagas, the ruling family of Mantua, as a copy of a painting by Titian (ca. 1490-1576), famous for his use of impasto (strokes of thick oil paint). Fetti also imitated Titian's signature on the neck of the Pharisee's shirt.

35155,oil paintings (visual works),Cupid with a Bow,oil on canvas,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/35155,"<p>This painting repeats, almost exactly, the composition of a smaller canvas attributed to Guido Reni that was in the collection of the dukes of Leuchtenberg in Munich and in St. Petersburg around the middle of the 19th century. As the Leuchtenberg painting is now missing and known only from an engraving, it is difficult to ascertain whether it was Reni's original or a copy. The Walters' painting appears to be by a close follower. Federico Zeri, in his 1976 catalogue of the Walters' Italian paintings (no. 357), suggested an attribution to Elisabetta Sirani. The painting was acquired by Henry Walters before 1929; no further provenance is known.

In search of exotic subjects he frequently traveled eastward, visiting Ukraine and the European parts of Turkey. A consummate painter of horses, Brandt shows a procession of Tartar horseman proceeding across a grassy plain dotted with colorful wildflowers. The figure on a dapple horse in the central foreground, startled by something in the rushes at the right, halts, brandishes his rifle, and raises his hand to caution his companion. In the background, the rest of the group rides across the hill toward the two figures in the foreground. The horsemen wear bright red pants, boots, and turbans with feathers; the turban of the man on the dapple horse is a particularly brilliant saffron. Along with the rifles they carry, each has additional weapons around their waists, including bows and axes. The reins and saddles of the horses are embellished by beads and decorative metalwork.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/36187"" rel=""external alternate main"">paintings</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

She specialized in paintings of animals. Bonheur's art was underpinned by detailed, analytical study, and she is known to have visited slaughterhouses and dissected animals to acquire an understanding of anatomy. This annotated drawing proves her attention to detail when sketching from life. In the 1850s, Bonheur kept a collection of horses, sheep, and goats in her Paris studio for study purposes. Later, she kept an even larger menagerie, including lions, at her château in By at the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where she moved in 1860 and lived for the rest of her life (""Rosa Bonheur,"" Bordeaux, 1997).</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/36320"" rel=""external alternate main"">watercolors (paintings)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

From May 1766 he worked in Paris and was elected a member of the academy. He portrayed several members of the French Royal Family and was appointed ""Peintre de Roi"" (Painter to the Court). After supporting the French Revolution he was forced into exile in 1791 and died in Belgium a few years later. Along with Jean Honoré Fragonard he introduced a looser style of miniature painting to France.

37377,paintings,Ploughing Scene,oil on canvas,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/37377,"<p>The heat of the noonday sun is palpable in this painting as drooling oxen drag a plough. They are followed by a man whose face is obscured by a hat, which shields him from the bright sun, while birds peck at the furrow left in their wake. Rosa Bonheur was among the most celebrated painters of animals in the 19th century. She frequently depicted plowing scenes that highlighted her command of animal anatomy, which she studied through dissection. This scene reverses the composition of her first work to gain major celebrity: “Ploughing in the Nivernais,” which was exhibited at the Salon and won a medal in 1849. In 1857–58 Rosa Bonheur’s fame and success in the United States was secured by the national tour of her dramatic 16-ft. (five-meter)-wide oil painting, The Horse Fair. The tour was organized by the dealer Ernest Gambart, who played a significant role in fostering a taste for European art among American collectors. Undocumented in any of the early catalogues of the Walters Art Museum, this painting seems to have been acquired by Henry Walters during the last few years of his life. The most successful and celebrated female artist of her time, in 1860, Bonheur purchased the château of By in the village of Thomery, not far from Barbizon, where she lived with a menagerie of exotic animals.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/37377"" rel=""external alternate main"">paintings</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

76634,figurines,Mouse,"smoky quartz, diamonds, gold, rubies",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/76634,"<p>This tiny hardstone mouse is studded with diamonds, and has rubies for eyes. The House of Fabergé began making hardstone animals in the 1890s and they proved popular with their elite clients. Queen Alexandra (wife of the British King Edward VII) built a large collection, and production peaked in the years immediately before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Objects such as this mouse were inspired by Japanese netsuke. Carl Fabergé owned over 500 of these. He married this admiration of Asian art with the rich Russian tradition of hardstone carving.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/76634"" rel=""external alternate main"">figurines</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

77482,body armor,Two-Piece Tasset,"etched and embossed, blackened and fire-gilded steel; copper alloy, leather",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/77482,"<p>This right tasset (hip and thigh defense) with virtuoso detailing is from an armor of Wilhelm V, duke of Jülich, Cleve, and Berg (1516-92).

24316,panel paintings; altarpieces; fragments,Saint John the Baptist and Saint James the Great,tempera and gold leaf on wood panel,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/24316,"<p>This painting shows Saints John the Baptist (left) and James the Great (right). John wears his typical camel skin shirt and holds a scroll reading “Behold the Lamb of God,” (in Latin, “Ecce Agnus Dei”), the phrase he famously used to present his cousin, Jesus Christ, to the public. James holds a book and a pilgrim’s staff, the latter alluding to Santiago de Compostella, the famous pilgrimage destination dedicated to him in Spain. The figures are depicted in elegant, swaying poses and dressed in bright, jewel-toned robes. These traits typical of the style known as “International Gothic,” a decorative and cosmopolitan style popular throughout Europe in the late 1300s and early 1400s. Giovanni Toscani was one of its major practitioners in Florence. 

The painting is the largest surviving fragment of a multi-paneled altarpiece commissioned in 1423 by the Ardinghelli, one of the wealthiest families in Renaissance Florence. Intended for their burial chapel in their neighborhood church of Santa Trinita, the altarpiece was unusual in that its central section was not a painting but a niche containing a relic believed to be part of the “True Cross” (the cross on which Christ was crucified). The Walters’ panel was originally the right wing of the altarpiece, so that John the Baptist, Florence’s patron saint, was pointing to the relic. The left wing of the altarpiece, now lost, depicted Saints Francis and Nicholas. The altarpiece also included three “pinnacles,” or crowning elements, depicting the Archangel Gabriel, the Virgin Annunciate (both in a private collection, Rome), and the Crucifixion (now in the Accademia, Florence), as well as a “predella,” or illustrated base, depicting scenes from the lives of the holy figures represented above. The predella panel originally placed beneath the Walters’ panel is now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/24316"" rel=""external alternate main"">panel paintings; altarpieces; fragments</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

It contains the fifty-third chapter of the Book of Isaiah, in English translation. The small book is composed of eight folios written and decorated on the rectos, leaving the versos blank. Script and decoration suggest that the book was conceived to imitate the style of fourteenth- or fifteenth-century French illumination. The creators, Eleanor Taylor and James Slie, signed the book on the title page, and declared their intended revival of this tradition. Each folio is embellished with border decoration showing narratives of Christ's life, as well as zoomorphic and foliate motifs in a palette of blue, red, and gold leaf. The contemporary binding is painted with a coat of arms inscribed with the motto ""GANG WARILY"" (proceed with caution). Although the manuscript has traditionally been considered to be of English origin, the armorial shield points to a Scottish use.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/32540"" rel=""external alternate main"">illuminated manuscripts</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

After supporting the French Revolution he was forced into exile in 1791 and died in Belgium a few years later. Along with Jean Honoré Fragonard he introduced a looser style of miniature painting to France.

Vasnetsov's contributions to the Russian Revival included his compositions recalling the nation's remote past. In this instance, he shows the aftermath of a battle that had been fought between the forces of Prince Igor of Novgorod-Seversk (1151-1201) and the Cumans or the Polovtsy, a nomadic Turkic people, in 1185 on the River Kayala. The Rus were overcome by the Cuman archers and Igor was captured. In the aftermath of the battle, Igor's Rus warriors lie strewn across the battle field while vultures hover nearby. The battle was immortalized in the epic poem, The Lay of Igor's Campaign, which was lost, but rediscovered in a monastery in Yaroslavl in 1785. The Lay subsequently inspired a number of artistic works including Alexander Borodin's opera, Prince Igor, first performed in 1890 and later revised by Rimsky-Korsakov. In addition, it served as the basis for a ballet of the same name completed by Sergei Diaghilev in 1909. 

The patterns in filigree have been executed with blue, turquoise, green, olive, brown and red painted enamels. Large stylized blossoms appear on the sides and ends of the box. As is characteristic of Rückert, the reddish-orange enamels bring out the colors of the shield and boots of the soldier in the painted battle scene.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/82305"" rel=""external alternate main"">boxes (containers)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

The merchant Kuzma Minin stands in the town square exhorting the citizens of Nizhnii Novgorod to donate their valuables in order to finance a volunteer army. Even the children in the foreground are surrendering their toys. Led by Prince Dmitrii Pozharskii (1577-1642), the army expelled the Poles from Moscow in August, 1612. The victory resulted in Michael Romanov being elected tsar the following year, thereby founding the Romanov dynasty. This box was probably intended to commemorate the Tercentenary of the dynasty in 1913.

The outward flaring sides of the box are decorated in painted enamel with patterns of cloud berries and curvilinear motifs as well as with tightly wound filigree and distinctive hatch marks.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/82308"" rel=""external alternate main"">boxes (containers); caskets (personal gear)</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"

82434,dishes; kovshi,Kovsh: Two Women,"silver gilt, painted matte and filigree enamel",https://art.thewalters.org/detail/82434,"<p>Within a cartouche on the front face of the kovsh is a scene painted in matte enamel portraying an older boyarina counseling a younger woman who is seated on a bench. The women's' lavish costumes and jewelry as well as the brocaded fabric on the background wall are indicative of their social status. Although the nature of the subject is in keeping with Konstantin Makovskii's matrimonial paintings, the actual source for this composition has not been identified. 

The sides of the kovsh are decorated with Rückert's characteristic motifs: triangles, spirals, trees, and abstract circular blossoms in his late muted colors: grayish blue, green, white and brown. 

The handle's angular shape may have been inspired by an early wooden kovsh. Its decoration adheres to the same color schemes and patterns used in the bowl although handle's upper and lower edges are executed in raised filigree enamel over a stippled gilt ground.

The immediate source for this composition has been identified as Konstantin Makovskii's The Boyar (1913), which was reproduced on the cover of Sol'ntse Rossii (The Sun of Russia) in March that year. Ultimately, the image is derived from the image of the old boyar, the central figure in Konstantin Makovskii's The Boyar Wedding Feast in the Seventeenth Century (1883), now in the Hillwood Museum, Washington, D.C.  An identical miniature painting is found on a slightly later Fabergé box bearing the inventory number 391831 in the Hillwood Museum (15.209). The Russian revival patterns of blossoms and geometric shapes are executed in blue, green, brown, red, black, and white painted filigree enamel against an opaque, light gray ground. Two exceptions, however, are the upper edge and end of the handle which is in painted filigree enamel over a gilt stippled ground. The numerous spirals and dots in wire filigree are associated with Rückert's productions.
Condition: The enamel on the handle shows signs of deterioration and repairs.

A young woman, whose unmarried status is indicated by her single braid of hair, is lounging against a table gazing wistfully towards the light. 

The surrounding painted filigree enamel decoration includes on each side three cloudberry-like blossoms and scrolling foliage rendered in brown, orange, light blue over an opaque deep blue ground.  Ample use is made of Rückert's characteristic decorative filigree spirals and hatchings. The color scheme of the handle is identical. Among the decorative motifs are leaves, checker board patterns, and triangular shapes.

In the twilight, a bogatyr mounted on a white horse gazes across a battlefield pondering which direction to take. He has been identified as the 12th-century Kievan Rus warrior, Il'ia Muromets, who is mentioned in the byliny, the Russian folk stories. A highlight of the Fabergé box is the exceptionally fine filigree enamel. On the front face appears a stylized griffin with a darting red tongue flanked by swans. Birds with long tails are depicted on the ends of the box. A distinctive feature is the manner in which the filigree and painted enamel designs invade the painted scene on the left side and along the bottom. These patterns are executed in a silver overlay rather than in wire filigree.

Their costumes have been highlighted with flicks of gilt. This composition has been identified either as Evening Walk or Return from Matins. The location of the original painting is presently unknown. 

The painted filigree decoration is in Rückert's late style with its characteristic abstract seed pods, blossoms, foliage, and gilt wire spirals.

Although the insertion of coins into the surfaces of silver vessels can be traced to the 17th century, if not earlier, Fabergé has elaborated on the practice by applying a bright strawberry red, en plein enamel to the background of the image.

In a teremok interior, a child and an older boy waving a peacock feather encourage a blindfolded young lady dressed in white while her companions seek to elude her. Incidental details include a mother seated with her child and companion, and a child stealing fruit from the table. The vaulted chamber is replete with scrolls of vine painted on the ceiling and with such furnishings as a large white tile stove, an icon, and a commode. The Kremlin Terem, restored after the designs of Fyodor Solntsev (1801-1892) in 1837, served as the prototype for the interior.

This box exemplifies Fedor Rückert's late style of painted filigree work in which ample use is made of decorative, filigree wire spirals and muted colors.

84344,quadriptychs; miniatures,Panel from the Stein Quadriptych,ink and paint on parchment,https://art.thewalters.org/detail/84344,"<p>The Stein Quadriptych was likely created in Bruges, and it has been attributed to Simon Bening and associates, ca. 1525-30. This collection of sixty-four miniatures depicting images of Christ's life is mounted in four panels, each in sets of sixteen miniatures per panel. The ensemble of miniatures was first cited in scholarly literature as the Stein Quadriptych because the earliest known owner of the collection was Charles Stein until 1886. The miniatures seem to have been dismantled at some point and then reassembled in four panels. No texts have been found on the backs of these miniatures by the Walters Conservation Department. However, because it was normal practice for illuminated folios to be inserted into South Netherlandish prayer books without accompanying text on the back, the lack of textual evidence does not rule out the possibility that these miniatures were once part of a prayer book. Based on formal visual analysis and the use of color, however, these 64 miniatures appear to have been meant to be viewed as an ensemble. The recitation of prayers from a book or from memory may have been intended while the suppliant viewed the visual program.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=""https://art.thewalters.org/detail/84344"" rel=""external alternate main"">quadriptychs; miniatures</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>"
